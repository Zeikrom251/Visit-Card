This project allowed me to work on creating a **digital visit card**. The goal was to design a modern and interactive way to show a visit card online. The digital card includes personal details, contact information, social media links, and an "***About Me***" section.

Additionally, this project gave me the opportunity to explore **NFC cards**, which can be used to share my digital card. With the help of NFC technology, users can access my digital card by tapping their NFC-enabled device against the card, offering a innovative way to exchange contact information.
